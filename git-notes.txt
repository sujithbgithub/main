HEAD :-

a reference variable
We call this variable a pointer, because its purpose is to reference, or point to, a specific commit in the repository
As we make new commits, the pointer changes, or moves, to point to a new commit
It's a way of tracking the current position in the repository.
It points to the tip of the current branch in our repository


BRANCH :-

Branches is to create a new set of code from what we're working on, and it's going to be separate from our master branch.
